# Cap3 standalone deploy tool

```sh
pkill -6 tail
```

#### Why?

1. I want to keep it separately. Keep deploy tool in rails app it's not best idea
2. I want to have independent deploy tool for many rails apps
3. I want to restrict access to deploy tool in team. Juniors shouldn't touch it.
4. It's should be easy to maintain and improve
5. It's should be base for branches: **cap3node**, **cap3django**, **cap3php** etc.

#### How to use?

1. Clone cap3rails
2. Copy config file
```
cp settings/production.yml.example settings/production.yml
```
3. Puts your settings in config file
4. ```cap production deploy```
5. Include App nginx config into your main nginx config
```
include /var/www/USER/data/www/MY_APP/shared/web_server/nginx/config;
```
6. restart nginx ```cap production nginx:restart```
7. Profit!!!

#### Who in the box?

1. **Settingslogic** for config files
2. **Nginx**, **Unicorn** config templates
3. Only **production** stage
4. Ready for small projects, but not for giants

#### Status of repo

It's a draft. It's need a lot of work, but it'a alive! You can try it.

#### Plans

1. To improve Unicorn configs
2. To add **Monit** configs
3. To add **Puma** templates
3. To drink tea with piece of chocolate
4. To take over the world
